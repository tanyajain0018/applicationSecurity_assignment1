1) cov1.gft is a test case that reaches case 10 in the animate function as the coverage report showed 
that none of my test cases reached case 10.

2) For cov2.gft, I set type of record to equal 2 so that the test case can reach all the uncovered if-statements 
that rely on gcrd_ptr->type_of_record to equal 2.

3) For fuzzer1.gft, after running for 2 hours, AFL produced 6 hangs. Out of those only 2 worked on my terminal 
and caused the program to hang. Both of those were due to the same bug, which was situated in Case 10 of the animate function. 
I just had to remove the word char from the if-statement so that arg1 stayed unsigned. This fixed fuzzer1.gft.

4) For fuzzer2.gft, AFL produced numerous crashes. For the one I fixed, I used printf statements to find the 
cause of the error which showed that it was also because of the animate function specifically case 7. 
Instead of using "puts(msg)" inside case 7, I changed it to printf msg. That fixed the bug.
